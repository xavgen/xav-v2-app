The goal of this website is to create a portfolio website to demonstrate my web development.
It should show my personality as well as everything I've done/achieved that contributes to my major.

The website includes the home, about, skills, projects, and involvement pages.

When the site is initially opened, the home page displays my name (Xavier Genio) and has navigation to 
the other parts of the page.

The font is mono which has made easy on the eye to read and follow. The overall deseign should be clean
and organized with a color palette of mostly purple and black. It also has a navigation bar at the top 
which, on the home page, appears after scrolling for a bit.
